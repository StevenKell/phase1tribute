                    Numpy is a Python package used for scientific computing across
                    various industries ranging from astronomy, energy,
                    finance, to medicine, and robotics. The foundation of Numpy is
                    arrays(Called ndarrays) that are much more efficient than the standard structures
                    built into Python. This performance is achieved through a number of
                    means such as making the ndarrays fixed in size after creation unlike built in Python list
                    structures,
                    removing the overhead required to make the lists dynamic. Another difference between the two being
                    that ndarray elements are contiguous in memory, allowing
                    memory maps to less complicated, and retrieval to be faster as algorithms can just stride back and
                    forth
                    rather than having to pull from random locations in memory.

                    Another method Numpy uses to achieve its efficiency is by calling functions that are written in C
                    and C++,
                    both having its own and by hooking into those built by others, such as Intel's OneMKL(Math Kernel
                    Library).
                    OneMKL streamlines the code execution by replacing Python loops where every instruction is preformed
                    one at a time with
                    SIMD(Single Instruction Multiple Data) commands that can perform several operations at one time.

                <p> Use of Numpy has helped with several scientific discoveries such as
                    <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://numpy.org/case-studies/blackhole-image/">the first
                        imaging of a black hole</a>. On a more day to day basis Numpy is used by machine learning
                    libraries such as Tensorflow to aide in
                    fraud detection, image analysis, and recommendation systems.

                    Numpy's other strength is the ecosystem surrounding it, which is
                    composed of the nonprofits and businesses that support its
                    development. The managing organization is NumFOCUS, which at this time oversees
                    Numpy and over 70 other projects focused on data science.
